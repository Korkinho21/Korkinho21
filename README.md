- 👋 Hi, I’m @Korkinho21. I'm a engineering student based in Valencia, currently on my last year.
- 👀 I’m interested in everything that involves Physics/Math and so forth. Lately, I discovered Data Science and I think it is really interesting too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code in Python. 
   I took part of a European Project to do my final degree thesis, my task was to create a model which simulates renewable energies generation, which was feeded from weather data.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate at open source projects.
- 📫 I don't think you are interested on my work by this time lol. Anyways, I'm available at gmail: korkinho21@gmail.com
